# Days Between
"""
How old are you in a number of days? It's easy to calculate - just subtract your birthday from today. We could make this a real challenge though and count the difference between any dates.

You are given two dates as an array with three numbers - a year, month and day. For example: 19 April 1982 will be (1982, 4, 19). You should find the difference in days between the given dates. For example between today and tomorrow = 1 day. The difference will always be either a positive number or zero, so don't forget about the absolute value.

Input: Two dates as tuples of integers.

Output: The difference between the dates in days as an integer.

Example:

days_diff((1982, 4, 19), (1982, 4, 22)) == 3
days_diff((2014, 1, 1), (2014, 8, 27)) == 238

How it is used: Python has batteries included, so in this mission youâ€™ll need to learn how to use completed modules so that you don't have to invent the bicycle all over again.

Precondition: Dates between 1 january 1 and 31 december 9999. Dates are correct.
